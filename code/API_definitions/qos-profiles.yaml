  title: QoS Profiles
  description: |
    The QoS Profiles API allows the discovery of Quality of Service (QoS) profiles and its characteristics.

    # Introduction

    QoS Profiles are used in conjunction with other Quality-On-Demand APIs, to offer the application developers the capability to request for stable latency (reduced jitter) or throughput for some specified application data flows between application clients (within a user device) and Application Servers (backend services). The developer has a pre-defined set of Quality of Service (QoS) profiles which they could choose from depending on their latency or throughput requirements. The QoS profiles are defined by the network operator and are mapped to the connectivity characteristics of the network.

    # API functionality

    The QoS Profiles API provides the following functionality:
    - Discovery of all QoS profiles offered by the network operator
    - Retrieve the characteristics of a specific QoS profile by name

    How QoS profiles are mapped to connectivity characteristics are subject to agreements between the communication service provider and the API invoker. Within the CAMARA project, you can find a sample for such a mapping of QoS profiles.

            This can result in improved user experience when there is additional network capacity.

            packets that receive a confirmation of receipt from the recipient (e.g.,
            using TCP). This requirement helps maintain consistent latency, essential
            for real-time applications such as VoIP, video calls, and gaming.

            For instance 3 would be an error loss rate of 10 to the power of -3 (0.001)

            For 5G network the 3GPP specification TS 23.203 defines the packet error loss rate QCI attribute. It
            describes the Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifier (QCI) parameters used to
            differentiate traffic classes in mobile networks, ensuring appropriate resource
            allocation and performance for various services.

            The packet error loss rate is one of the QCI attributes, providing information on the
            acceptable packet loss rate for a specific traffic class. This attribute helps maintain
            the desired performance level for services like voice calls, video streaming, or data
            transfers within the 3GPP mobile network.
